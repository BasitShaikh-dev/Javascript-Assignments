/*

Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
Store the names of these animals in a list,
and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.

• Modify your program to print a statement about each animal,
such as A dog would make a great pet. 

• Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common.
You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
