//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

var friends = ["Jamal","Umair","hamza"];
console.log("hi "+friends[0]+" How are you!");
console.log("hi "+friends[1]+" How are you!");
console.log("hi "+friends[2]+" How are you!");
